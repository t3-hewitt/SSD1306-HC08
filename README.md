# SSD1306-HC08
Update of previous repository. Simple project for displaying strings and bitmaps recieved via the Bluetooth HC08 module (UART) to the SSD1306 diaply (I2C)
Please see https://github.com/t3-hewitt/SSD1306-Android-Application for android app

WORK IN PROGRESS

Current stage - Strings and Characters now working, bitmap images from phone display correctly, but speed could be improved,
Set baud rate on HC08 to 115200 - and now use DMA rx for UART
